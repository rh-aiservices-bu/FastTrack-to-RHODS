= Validation

At this stage, and before you modify and/or customize your RHODS environment in any way, it's a good time to confirm that your users can access it. +
These instructions will walk you through some very basic validation activities.

[#logindashboard]
== 4.1 Log into RHODS

[#rhodsurl]
=== Get the RHODS URL

* From the OpenShift Console, click on the application menu, and choose Red Hat OpenShift Data Science.
+

+
* This will open a new tab.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::rhods.url.png[]
+
* This URL is the main RHODS URL, and the only one that you need to share with your RHODS end-users.
* Its pattern should usually be something like:
[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
https://rhods-dashboard-.................openshiftapps.com/
----
* Save it or Bookmark it for later reference.

[#authenticate]
=== Authenticate

* Click on the **Log in with OpenShift** button (from the screenshot above).
* You will be prompted with one or more possible Identity Providers to choose from, depending on how your OpenShift Authentication is configured.

+
* If this is your very first time using the environment, you will be prompted to Authorize Access.
  Make sure to **allow select permissions** if you see that screen:
+

+
* If all goes well, you should now see the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science dashboard
+

=== Spawn a JupyterHub Notebook

* You want to make sure that you are able to successfully spawn a Jupyter notebook.
* Click on the "Launch" icon.
+

* You will be prompted to choose an identity provider and the matching credentials again.

  Make sure to **allow select permissions** if you see that screen:
+

* On the next screen,
** select the **Minimal Python** Notebook Image
** select the **Default** Container Size

* If you need more details on how to use it, you can check: link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-data-science/getting-started/launch-red-hat-openshift-data-science[Jupyter Notebooks Learning path]
* Close the tab, and continue with the instructions below:

[#getstarted]
== 4.2 Get your users started with RHODS

Assuming the steps above were successful, your environment should be ready for use. +
To get your users started with it:

* Share the URL captured earlier, so they can access RHODS directly
** Remember that the RHODS URL looks like the following:
[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
https://rhods-dashboard-.................openshiftapps.com/
----
* If there are more than one Authentication Methods defined in your OpenShift, +
  let your users know which one they should be using.
* If your users are unfamiliar with RHODS, they should consult the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-data-science/getting-started/launch-red-hat-openshift-data-science[RHODS Learning path], which will guide them through the first steps.
