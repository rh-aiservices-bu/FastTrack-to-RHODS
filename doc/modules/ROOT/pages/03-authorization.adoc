= Configure RHODS Authorization

== Default configuration

Starting with RHODS version 1.8.0-14, the default Authorization for RHODS is configured as follows:

* Any user who can successfully authenticate to OpenShift is automatically a RHODS **User**
* Any OpenShift "dedicated-admin" user is automatically a RHODS **Admin**

These settings make it extremely simple to get started using RHODS, and should usually be kept as-is, at least to start with.

== Restrictive configuration (Optional)

If your Identity Provider contains thousands of users, but only a few of them should be able to use RHODS, you will likely want to reconfigure the Authorization settings for RHODS, to explicitly list the few users that are allowed to do so.

At a high level, you would:

1. Create an OpenShift group
2. Add the IDs of the individual users to the newly created group
3. Edit the configmap called `rhods-groups-config` in the `redhat-ods-applications` namespace
4. Rollout the JupyterHub pods for the settings to take hold

This is explained in greated details in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_science/1/html/managing_users_and_user_resources/adding-users-for-openshift-data-science_useradd#adding-existing-user-groups-from-an-identity-provider-to-openshift-data-science_useradd[Adding existing user groups from an identity provider to OpenShift Data Science] section of the documentation.
