If you already have a cluster, you should read the summarized xref:#cluster-requirements[cluster requirements] below.

If you are certain that your cluster meets all these requirements, you can skip straight to the "xref:03-rhods.adoc[Get RHODS]" section.

No::

If you don't yet have a Managed OpenShift Cluster, you will need to keep reading this page in order to:

* Be aware of the xref:#cluster-requirements[cluster requirements]
* Choose between xref:#chooseOSDROSA[ROSA and OSD]
* Decide if you want to use the 60-day xref:#chooseOSDROSA[OSD Trial]

[#cluster-requirements]
== Managed OpenShift Cluster Requirements for RHODS

* It has to be a **Managed** OpenShift:
** either RedHat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) or OpenShift Dedicated (OSD)
** not a general OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster
* It has to be on **AWS**
** It cannot be an on-prem cluster
** Only AWS is currently supported
* You need to have access to both:
** the link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Console]
** the OpenShift Web Console of your cluster
* The version of OpenShift needs to be
** OpenShift 4.9 or higher
* If you are using ROSA, ensure that the cluster was **NOT** deployed with the `--sts` option
* OpenShift Authentication needs to be configured

[#redhataccount]
== About your RedHat.com account

* Whether you use OSD or ROSA, you will need to link:https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html[sign up for a Red Hat login].
* When you do, there are two types of account: **Corporate** or **Personal**.
* It is very likely that your organization already has a Corporate Account with Red Hat.
** If that is the case, you should ask to be granted access to it.
* If your organization does not yet have an account, you should create a **Corporate** one even if you will be the only person using these resources. It makes sharing the work and transferring ownership of environments much more straightforward.
