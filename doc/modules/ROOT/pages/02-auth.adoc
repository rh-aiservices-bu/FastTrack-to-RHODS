= Configure OpenShift Authentication

CAUTION: Under construction

RHODS itself has no particular authentication settings. +
Instead, it relies on how OpenShift's authentication has been configured.

Therefore, it's important to have at least one Identity Provider configured.

The steps below will walk you through 2 fairly simple Identity Providers to get you started.

[#htpasswd]
== Configure HTPasswd as an Identity Provider

This is a good option to use if you only need a single user and/or if you want to start by creating a Cluster Administrator account.

That is how we will set it up:

=== Add the Identity Provider

* Choose the **Access control** tab for your cluster
* Select **Identity providers**
* Click the Dropdown to **Add identity provider** and choose **HTPasswd**

+
* On the next screen, keep all the defaults, including the suggested username and password
* MAKE SURE TO SAVE THEM SOMEWHERE. +
They will not be shown to you again.
+

** Enter the name of the `admin-` account that was created in the previous step, and choose **Cluster-Admins**
+

* If your screen looks like the above, kudos, you've just created an admin account for your OpenShift cluster

[#github]
== Configure GitHub as an Identity provider for additional users

CAUTION: Under construction

One of the fastest, yet simple, ways to grant OpenShift access to many users is to add a GitHub Identity provider to your OpenShift Cluster.

This requires you and them to have a GitHub account, but nothing else is needed.

If you've never done it before, the instructions below will guide you.

=== Create a GitHub Organization and OAuth application

* Log into GitHub
* Create a new Org. (Must be an "Owner")
* settings
* developer settings (bottom)
* new OAuth App
* ...

=== configure that org as an authentication provider

* console.redhat.com
* Add Identity provider (GitHub)
* Fill in Client Id and Client secret from Org settings
* ...

=== Make your Github users a cluster-admin

* console.redhat.com
* Access Control
* Add user (Github Id)
* cluster-admin

=== Invite your users to your GitHub org

* invite users (based on their GitHub user id)
*

=== (optional) remove the HTPasswd

* enforece 2FA on GitHub
* remove HTPasswd as a way to log in
