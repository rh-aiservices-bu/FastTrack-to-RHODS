= Configure OpenShift Authentication

CAUTION: Under construction

RHODS itself has no particular authentication settings. +
Instead, it relies on how OpenShift's authentication has been configured.

Therefore, it's important to have at least one Identity Provider configured.

The steps below will walk you through 2 fairly simple Identity Providers to get you started.

[#htpasswd]
== Configure HTPasswd as an Identity Provider

This is a good option to use if you only need a single user and/or if you want to start by creating a Cluster Administrator account.

That is how we will set it up:

=== Add the Identity Provider

* Choose the **Access control** tab for your cluster
* Select **Identity providers**
* Click the Dropdown to **Add identity provider** and choose **HTPasswd**

* On the next screen, keep all the defaults, including the suggested username and password
* MAKE SURE TO SAVE THEM SOMEWHERE. +
They will not be shown to you again.
+
