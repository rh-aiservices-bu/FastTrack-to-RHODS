= Configure OpenShift Authentication

CAUTION: Under construction. This page is still a work in progress.

RHODS itself has no particular authentication settings. +
Instead, it relies on how OpenShift's authentication has been configured.

Therefore, it's important to have at least one Identity Provider configured.

The steps below will walk you through 2 fairly simple Identity Providers to get you started.

[#htpasswd]
== Configure HTPasswd as an Identity Provider

This is a good option to use if you only need a single user and/or if you want to start by creating a Cluster Administrator account.

That is how we will set it up:

=== Add the Identity Provider

* Choose the **Access control** tab for your cluster
* Select **Identity providers**
* Click the Dropdown to **Add identity provider** and choose **HTPasswd**
+

+
* On the next screen, keep all the defaults, including the suggested username and password
* MAKE SURE TO SAVE THEM SOMEWHERE. +
They will not be shown to you again.
+

=== Make this new user a Cluster-Admin

* Select **Cluster Roles and Access**
** Click **Add User**
+

+
** Enter the name of the `admin-` account that was created in the previous step, and choose **Cluster-Admins**
+

choose **HTPasswd**, the one we just added
+

* On the next screen, enter the credentials that we were generated for you.
+

+
* You should now be logged into the OpenShift Console
+

* If your screen looks like the above, kudos, you've just created an admin account for your OpenShift cluster

[#github]
== Configure GitHub as an Identity provider for additional users

One of the fastest, yet simple, ways to grant OpenShift access to many users is to add a GitHub Identity provider to your OpenShift Cluster.

This requires you and them to have a GitHub account, but nothing else is needed.

If you’ve never done it before, the instructions below will guide you.

=== Create a GitHub Organization

* Log into GitHub and go to the link:https://github.com/settings/organizations[Organizations] page
* Create a new Org. (Must be an “Owner”)
// ** Top right profile icon -> Settings
** Organizations -> New Organization
+
[.bordershadow]
image::new.org.png[]
+
** Choose to create a free Organization
+
[.bordershadow]
image::free.org.png[]
+
** Fill out and indicate if creating an enterprise org
+
[.bordershadow]
image::org.name.png[]
+
* Enforce 2FA within the GitHub Organization
** This setting requires invited users to activate another authentication method 
+
[.bordershadow]
image::require.twofa.png[]
+
* Your new Organization should now be ready
* Invite additional users to the organization
+

=== Secure your organization with OAuthenticaton and configure Github Identity provider

* github.com
** Open Github org -> Settings
+
[.bordershadow]
image::org.settings.png[]
+

** Developer settings **(bottom)**
** OAuth Apps
** Register an application

* console.redhat.com
** Copy the link from **Open console** Button into the **Homepage URL** on Github

* Choose the Access control tab for your cluster
* Select Identity providers
* Add identity provider (GitHub)
** Copy **callback url** into Authorization URL
** Register application

+

+

* Copy Client ID into the Identity Page
* Create a Client Secret Key
** Copy Client Secret into Identity Page
* Fill in Organization Name
* **Save**

=== Make yourself and other GitHub users cluster-admins (Must be in Org)
* Choose the Access control tab for your cluster
** Select **Cluster Roles and Access**
** Add user **(Provide Github Username)**
+
