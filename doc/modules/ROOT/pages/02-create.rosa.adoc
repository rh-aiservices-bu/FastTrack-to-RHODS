= Create a ROSA Cluster

CAUTION: Under construction. These instructions are currently only references to other sets of instructions.

If you have never setup a ROSA Cluster before, the instructions available at https://www.rosaworkshop.io/rosa/1-account_setup/ should be useful.

**HOWEVER**, note that these instructions rely on the `sts` option for AWS credentials, and that is at the moment NOT Supported by RHODS.
If you follow them, make sure that you **DO NOT** use the `--sts` option when creating the cluster.
