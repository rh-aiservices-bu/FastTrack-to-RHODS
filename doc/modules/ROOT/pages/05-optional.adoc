[#autoscaling]
== Using auto-scaling Machine Pools

CAUTION: Under construction.

Using Auto-Scaling Machine Pools allows your environment to grow and shrink based on usage.

[#rhodsaccess]
== Restrict Access to RHODS to only a few users

CAUTION: Under construction.

Any user who can log into OpenShift can also use RHODS. If you want to restrict RHODS access to only specific OpenShift Users, you can consult the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_science/1/html/managing_users_and_user_resources/adding-users-for-openshift-data-science_useradd[documentation on how to add users].

[#selfprovision]
== Restrict OpenShift Self-Provisionning to RHODS users

Most OpenShift environments are configured in such a way that users who can authenticate to OpenShift also have the "self-provisioner" role. +
Having this role allows a user to create an OpenShift Project themselves. +
This can be great for developers but might be too impactful if the number of users who can authenticate is high. +
Therefore, a fairly standard OpenShift practice is to reduce the number of users who have this ability. +
(If you want more details on this, you should consult link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/applications/projects/configuring-project-creation.html#disabling-project-self-provisioning_configuring-project-creation[the documentation on disabling project self-provisioning] for more info).

The fast way to implement this change is to

* locate the right ClusterRoleBinding (**self-provisioners**)
+

+
* change the default
** from `system:authenticated:oauth` to the name of the group containing your RHODS users, often `rhods-users`
** Make sure to modify the `autoupdate` line as illustrated in the above video.

While this role can be useful when users need to be self-sufficient in creating OpenShift Projects, it's not required for RHODS.

Therefore, it's possible that you might want only a subset of RHODS users to have it. If that is the case, then:

* create a group in OpenShift
* assign the right users to it
* update the ClusterRoleBinding to use that group instead.
